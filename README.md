# dotfiles
If you're not me, this is probably not for you. There are better starting points for using dotfiles I'm sure!

## Notes to self
Easy-install:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomrijndorp/dotfiles/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh | source


## Other installations to consider for Mac
VirtualBox
XCode
Wunderlist
Unreal Engine
iTerm2
Steam

## Current issues
The stock Ubuntu bashrc contains quite a bit of logic and it's probably there for a reason. Might want to find a
way to have that thing remain and have it call your entrypoint instead.
